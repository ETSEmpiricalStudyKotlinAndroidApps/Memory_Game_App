This is an Android Memory Game Application. I made this on Android Studio in Kotlin. This Project helped me in Learning Kotlin to an Advanced level and also I got a Hands-On Experience of working on Android Studio.
<p> You can Play on your own Custom Pictures from your Phone and enjoy the Game. </p>
<p>Below are some Screenshots from the Application.</p>
